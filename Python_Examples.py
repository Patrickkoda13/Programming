#Variables

#Code in this section are examples of different ways to list variables and values.


#message = ("What it do, gir")

#print (message)

#message =("We back in here, hunny")

#print (message)

#man ="62"

#woman = "40"

#print(man+woman)

#cup ="water"

#print(cup)

#cup ="Sand"

#print(cup)

#crate = ["Sand", "Water", 7,5.9,True] #list-variable that can hold multiple values at the same time that can be different data types. Also called an "array" in other languages. 
#Index-Value listed in the list/array. 

#print(crate[3])

#Calculations

#firstValue = 50

#secondValue= 200

#operation - addition

#firstValue + secondValue 

#result = firstValue operator secondValue

#print(result)

#operator = '+''

#fstrings & methods (Code below has examples of fstrings and a method"title")


#first_name = "ada"

#last_name = "lovelace"

#full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"

#message = (f"Hello, {full_name.title()}!")

#print(message)

#Whitespace (Tabs, New lines, etc)

#Tabs- See example below for adding tabs in code. 

#print("Python")

#print("\tPython")

#Newlines- See example below for adding new line. 

#print("Languages:\nPython\nC\nJavascript")

#Concatenation- combining 2 or more strings of data together. 


#string1 ="Mike"
#string2 = "4.5"
#string3 ="0"
#string4 ="true"
#string5="6"

#print(string1 + ' does not know that to be ' +string4)

#Numbers With numbers, combining is just addition, not concatenation. Cannot print a string and numbers together. 

#number1 =4.5

#number2 =0

#number3 =5

#number4 =-4

#number5 =543545654

#print(number1 + number3)

#print(number1 + string1)

#Boolean-

#age =35



#Is_Student_Active = True #yes

#print(Is_Student_Active)

#Is_Graduate = False #no

#print (Is_Graduate)

#if(age >45):
   ## print('yes')

#if(age<45):
   # print("no")

# name = "Mike" #string- s

# age = 55 #number- d

# print("His name is %s and he is %d" % (name,age))

# sample_list =["Mike","Love","Dove"]

# print("some text %s" % sample_list)

#len()-used to know the length of a string. Length includes amount of characters and spaces between characters. 

#string methods

#string ="I am a string"

#string2 ="mike b"

#string3 ="BOOM BAYAH"

#print(len(string))

#print(string2.index("e"))

#print(string[1:3:8])

#print(string.upper())

#print(string3.lower())

#Operators- allows you to perform actions on one or more things. (+, -, *, /)

#first_value = 4
#second_value = 7

#addition

#print(first_value + second_value)

#print(first_value - second_value)

#print(first_value / second_value)

#assignment operator = equal to sign. Used to assign a value to something. 

#comparison operator(==)

#print(first_value == second_value) #comparing if these two values are equal. Returns back false with current values. 

#Greaterthan

#print(first_value > second_value)

#lessthan

#print(first_value < second_value)

#GreaterthanorEqualTo

#print(first_value >= second_value)

#reminder- Divides value and gives you the remainder from the division. 

#print(first_value % second_value)

#voice ="Scream "

#print(voice * 5)

#squad = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

#print(squad *3)


#A = [1,2,3,4]

#B = [5,6,7,8]

#print(A + B)


#Conditional-expression that will only be executed if a certain condition is met. 
#When using conditionals, must add ":" at end of condition before printing due to syntax rules.

#age = 17.5

#movie = "scary-terry"

#if(age == 18):
#print('Customer can purchase ticket for movie' + movie)
#if(age < 18):

   #print('Customer cannnot purchase ticket for movie')

#and/or
#and- two or more conditions must be true for test to pass.
#or- only one condition is required to be true for test to pass. 

#age = 18
#height = 5

#if(age >=18 and height >=5): #and code would pass test here.
  # print("Allowed to ride")

#if(age < 18 and height < 5) the test for and would not pass since one condition is not true. Better to use "or".

#if(age < 18 or height < 5):
   #print("Not allowed to ride")

#elif- The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

#elif(age < 18 or height < 5):
  # print("Not allowed to ride")

#else:
   #print("Error, something went wrong, girl")
